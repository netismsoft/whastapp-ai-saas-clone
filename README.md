## Stripe Number Formatter Zapier Template(if users enter their number in a wrong format in the Stripe checkout)

## Monetization Features

- Free tier with message limit (default: 10 messages)
- Premium subscription handling via Stripe
- Usage tracking per user
- Automatic subscription status checks
- Payment webhook integration
- Stripe pricing table integration (Embed your pricing table URL in botConfig.js subscription message)

ðŸ’¡: Create a Stripe pricing table and embed it in your landing page. When users exceed their message limit, they'll be directed to a professional pricing page where they can easily upgrade their subscription.

## Stripe
- Make sure you enable "phone number required" in the stripe payment link or pricing table. Like this you will identify if a user is subsrcibed.

## Privacy Message Feature

The bot automatically sends a welcome message to every first-time user that includes:
- Information about your service
- Privacy/data handling notices
- Free message limits
- Instructions for using the bot

This message is sent only once per user and is tracked in the database with the `welcome_sent` flag. You can:
- Customize the welcome message in `botConfig.js`
- Enable/disable the feature with the `welcome.enabled` setting
- The message is automatically saved in the conversation history

## API Endpoints

- `POST /webhook`: WhatsApp webhook endpoint
- `GET /webhook`: WhatsApp webhook verification endpoint

## Customization

All bot settings can be configured in `src/config/botConfig.js`:

### AI Settings
- Model name and parameters
- System prompt and personality
- Image and audio analysis settings
- Context message limit

### Welcome/Privacy Settings
- Customizable welcome message text
- Enable/disable welcome messages

### Subscription Settings
- Free message limit
- Subscription messages
- Payment link

### Apple Pay Billing Address Removal (Optional Feature)
This feature addresses an issue where Apple Pay automatically adds billing addresses to Stripe customers, 
which can cause problems with subscription verification. When enabled, this feature:

1. Listens for new customer creation events from Stripe webhooks
2. Automatically removes billing address details from customers
3. Preserves essential contact information like phone numbers and emails

To enable this feature:
1. Set `STRIPE_REMOVE_BILLING_ADDRESS=true` in your `.env` file
2. In Stripe search for "webhooks" and click on "add endpoint"
3. Create a Stripe webhook in your dashboard pointing to `https://your-railway-domain.app/payment/webhook/stripe`
4. Configure it to listen for the events `customer.created` and `payment_method.attached`
5. Get the **webhook signing secret** from Stripe and set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env` file

This feature is completely optional and won't affect the rest of the system if not configured.

### Access Control
- Blocked country codes
- Block messages

### WhatsApp Settings
- Rate limiting
- Message expiry
- Retry attempts
- API endpoints
